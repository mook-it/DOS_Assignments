# COP5615 â€“ Fall 2018

# Project Directory Structure

- Main directory contains Project Problem statement pdf and directory named code which contains the elixir mix project
- In lib we have two files [proj1.exs] and [multi_machine.exs] which are used in this project to solve the problem
- [proj1.exs] contains the main code 
- [multi_machine.exs] which contain the code for running the system on two machines
- [worker.ex] in code(directory name) is helper module for multi machine processes.

# Instructions for running the code

After unziping the file 
```sh
$ cd code
$ mix run lib/proj1.exs 3 2
```
Where 3 is the number N which is range in which the first number of solution set should lie. And 2 is the value of K that is maximum size of the solution set

We are running for num_process increasing from 1 to 20 in each iteration. Hence each iteration prints the number of workers and time taken in that iteration

Result format: the result of the project will be solution set of the problem in first line followed by time taken in each iteration

#  Questions to be answered
1. Size of the work unit that you determined results in best performance for your implementation and an explanation on how you determined it. Size of the work unit refers to the number of sub-problems that a worker gets in a single request from the boss.

- Following graph is for N=1_000_000 and k=1_000 to calculate the optimized value of workUnit for the best performance. 

![Alt text](https://github.com/prafful13/DOS_Projects/blob/master/assign1/code/images/graph.png "Graph")

- We can observe from the graph that optimized value of workunit that gives the best results is in the range 6-10.

2. The result of running your program for mix run proj1.exs 1_000_000 4

- No solution was found for this case and with time 1.63034 sec and CPU/time=3.01

3. The running time for the above as reported by time for the above. The ratio of CPU time to REAL TIME tells you how many cores were effec- tively used in the computation.

 Depending upon the workunit 

| Workunit | Time |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2 | 2.149726 |
 | 4 |    1.63813 |
|   6  |   1.650756|
 |  8  |   1.63034 |
 |  10  |    1.624344|
  | 12     | 1.86529 |
  | 14     |1.940466|
 |  16   |  1.793477|
|   18    | 2.464876 |
 | 20  |   1.80413|

### We calculated the ratio of CPU/real time = 3.9 for N=1000_000 k=1000

real	22m14.858s
user	80m42.700s
sys	0m17.781s

4. The largest problem you managed to solve

N = 1000_000 k = 1000
Workers: 8 time: 15.484459 sec

N = 10_000_000 k = 1000
Workers: 8 time: 238.7258 sec

# Proof of concurrency

- For proof of concurrency one way of doing this is using the CPU/real time ratio which our system gives a value ranging from 3 to 4. As our system is 4 core system

- Another way of doing this by exploting various tools like fprof for profiling service and observer service of erlang VM. fprof gets clumsy hence we won't be explaining it here. We are going to run two different codes for showing concurrency and recording system usage using :observer.start()

- Observation for code lacking concurrency: this code calls various actors but sequential

- Observation for our current code having cocurrency: this code spwans various actors together and uses a scheduler to communicate through various actors. Here the actors run on different process in different cores

# Instructions for bonus part

- We tried to connect two machines using the Node functionality of erlang VM and extened our previous code to run on two different machines. 

- For this we have to use two files in our lib folder that is mutli-machine.exs and worker.exs.

- We have to set up a Node connection between two remote devices. The Importent thing here to noticed that cookie value should be same so that system can communicate with each other, there it is "elixir"

- Now on our remote system compile the worker module by runnig the iteractive elixir (iex) use the following commands. NOTE to be in the directory of the worker.ex

```sh
$ iex --sname prafful --cookie elixir
$ c('worker.ex')
```

Now run the following command on your host machine

```sh
$ elixir --sname siddhant1 --cookie elixir  lib/multi_machine.exs 1000000 4
```

We will be running 100 workUnits(50 on one and 50 on other)
